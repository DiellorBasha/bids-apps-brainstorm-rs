# Security Considerations

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for BIDS Apps Brainstorm.

## Container Security

### Base Image Security

- Regularly update base images to patch vulnerabilities
- Use official MATLAB images from MathWorks
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Consider using minimal base images to reduce attack surface

### Runtime Security

```bash
# Run with read-only filesystem where possible
docker run --read-only -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ...

# Drop unnecessary capabilities
docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=CHOWN --cap-add=DAC_OVERRIDE ...

# Run as non-root user
docker run --user $(id -u):$(id -g) ...

# Limit resources
docker run --memory=8g --cpus=4 ...
```

## Data Security

### Input Data Protection

- **Anonymization**: Ensure all input data is properly anonymized
- **Encryption**: Use encrypted storage for sensitive datasets
- **Access Control**: Implement proper file permissions (600 for data files)
- **Audit Trail**: Log data access and processing activities

### Output Data Handling

- Review outputs for potential re-identification information
- Secure transmission of results using encrypted channels
- Implement data retention policies
- Document data provenance and processing steps

## Network Security

### Container Networking

```bash
# Disable network access if not needed
docker run --network=none ...

# Use custom networks for multi-container setups
docker network create --driver bridge brainstorm-net
```

### Data Transfer

- Use secure protocols (SFTP, HTTPS) for data transfer
- Verify data integrity with checksums
- Implement authentication for remote data access

## Vulnerability Management

### Regular Updates

- Monitor security advisories for MATLAB and dependencies
- Update containers regularly
- Subscribe to security notifications

### Security Scanning

```bash
# Scan Docker images
docker scan bids-apps-brainstorm:latest

# Check for known vulnerabilities
trivy image bids-apps-brainstorm:latest
```

## Compliance Considerations

### Research Data Protection

- Follow institutional IRB/ethics guidelines
- Implement GDPR compliance measures where applicable
- Maintain documentation of security measures
- Regular security assessments

### HIPAA Compliance (if applicable)

- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement access controls and audit logs
- Use business associate agreements
- Regular security risk assessments

## Best Practices

### Development

- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use secrets management for credentials
- Implement input validation and sanitization
- Regular security code reviews

### Deployment

- Use production-ready orchestration (Kubernetes with security policies)
- Implement monitoring and alerting
- Regular backup and disaster recovery testing
- Incident response procedures

### Access Management

```bash
# Example secure deployment with limited permissions
docker run \
  --user 1000:1000 \
  --read-only \
  --tmpfs /tmp:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=1g \
  --volume /secure/data:/data:ro \
  --volume /secure/output:/output:rw \
  --cap-drop=ALL \
  --security-opt=no-new-privileges \
  bids-apps-brainstorm:latest /data /output participant
```

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to [security contact]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure
